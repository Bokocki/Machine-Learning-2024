        "\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" – the famous title of Philip K. Dick’s novel – raises a fascinating question: if artificial intelligence could dream, what would it see?  \n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, we explore a phenomenon known as **neural network dreams**, where instead of optimizing a neural network's weights, we **optimize the input itself** to achieve a desired classification outcome. Given a fully trained MNIST classification network, your goal is to manipulate its inputs so that it confidently predicts each digit from 0 to 9, starting from pure noise.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **Tasks Description**  \n",
        "\n",
        "During this class we designed and trained a **MNIST classification neural network**, which takes a **batch of grayscale images** of size **$28 \\times 28$** as input and outputs a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes (0–9). However, instead of using real MNIST images, you will **treat the input batch itself as a set of trainable parameters** and optimize it so that the network classifies each image as a specific digit.  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Your first task is to generate **a batch of 10 images**, where each image is\n",

        "1. Start with a **batch of 10 random Gaussian noise images** as the initial input and $(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9)$ as the expected output batch of target digits.  \n",
        "2. Define the objective: maximize the neural network's confidence for the corresponding target digit for each image in the batch.  \n",
        "3. Use **gradient descent** to modify the pixels in each image, making the network classify each one as the assigned digit.  \n",

        "- The neural network weights **must remain frozen** during optimization. You are modifying only the input images.  \n",
        "- The loss function should be the **cross-entropy loss** between the predicted probabilities and the desired class labels.  \n",
