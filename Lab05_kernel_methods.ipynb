        "-----------------------  \n",
        "\n",
        "Kernel methods are a class of machine learning techniques that enable models to capture complex relationships in data by mapping inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Instead of working directly with raw features, kernel methods rely on kernel functions that compute inner products in these transformed spaces, allowing models to discover nonlinear patterns while avoiding explicit feature transformations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental idea behind kernel methods is to leverage the **kernel trick**, which replaces explicit high-dimensional computations with efficient similarity measurements. This approach is particularly useful in algorithms like **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, **kernel regression**, and **Gaussian processes**, where the goal is to find decision boundaries or make predictions in feature spaces that may be infeasible to compute directly.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Kernel methods are crucial for problems where linear models fail to capture the underlying structure, enabling flexible, nonlinear decision functions without excessive computational cost. They also provide a principled framework for incorporating domain knowledge through custom kernel functions, making them widely applicable across diverse fields such as bioinformatics, computer vision, and natural language processing.\n"
